## 🔹 Project Overview

This is a WhatsApp-style Chat Application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS.  
It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for chat messages.

I developed this project as part of my learning journey to practice Express routing, MongoDB operations, and backend logic using Mongoose.
